                            My experience with design begins in highschool when taking art classes that began to teach me the foundations of design.
                            For several years in high school I created posters in class using <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>, <b>Adobe InDesign</b>, and <b>Adobe Illustrator</b>.
                            Once I graduated and moved to university I began learning more complex theories of design, as well as how to tie them
                            all together when creating a brand image. In several classes I have learned how to apply the same theories across
                            several mediums to properly exemplify what a product or brand wants to show.

                            <p class="fontSideLeft">

                              This poster was created in January of 2018 as part of a project for my Digital Design course. The purpose of the assignment was to demonstrate
                              the able to capture an artist's image and history using design elements ranging from colour theory to the use of lines and planes to
                              draw the eyes in.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fontSideLeft">
                                While creating this poster I thought about who Eminem is within his music as well as within his life in order to fully capture the complexity
                                of his history. I figured that the best way to do this was to show both sides of the coin, with the two sides being Marshall Mathers
                                 and Slim Shady (left to right). These two personalities heavily conflict with one another, one being more cool and calm, while the other
                                 was full of anger and heat, leading to the choice of red and blue as the two contrasting colours. Underneath each of the two sides of
                                 Eminem are two artists that they've worked with that bring out the respective sides within the music. On the left with Marshall Mathers
                                 is Dr. Dre and Proof, and on the right with Slim Shady are Royce da 5'9 and 50 Cent. All of them are focused around the microphone, the tool
                                 that gave all of these artists their voices and subsequent success. The comic book effect used on all the images is to reflect
                                 the part that comic books played in Eminem's childhood that are seen within his lyrics.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fontSideLeft">
                                This piece was created by using the Image Trace tool in <b>Adobe Illustrator</b> to give the images their comic book look. Once all of
                                them had matching looks, they were all imported into <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>, where they were all recoloured and then assembled together.
                                Once the assembly was completed I created a background behind it that fit with the theme, helping to seperate each side while also
                                showing their connection. I exported these two assets seperately, and then imported them into <b>Adobe InDesign</b>. Once I was finished
                                adjusting the assembly and the background I added in the logo with a light glow effect, and added in the lettering around the bottom.

                            This ad was made in March 2017 as part of a Digital Design project in school requiring the student to create a magazine ad of a superhero. The theme
                            that I chose was a retro videogame ad featuring the superhero space cadet, Star Boy. As part of the assignment, I had to alter
                            a picture of myself to look like the superhero, so that's where I began.
                        </p>

                        <p class="fontSideLeft">
                            I started by taking the photograph of myself and bringing it into <b>Adobe Photoshop</b>. I found a copyright-free image of a spacesuit and overlayed
                            it where my body was. Once they were connected the lighting matched on both the face and spacesuit, I used an effect on <b>Photoshop</b> to
                            pixelate the entire image, bringing it back to the arcade-era.
                        </p>


                        <p class="fontSideLeft">
                            Once that was created I began making the pixel art logos and characters in <b>Adobe Illustrator</b>. After I was finished, I took all the created
                            assets and assembled them with the background using <b>Adobe InDesign</b>. Multiple shapes were added in to simulate the objects in the background
                            to create the word wrap effect. The fonts used were chosen from various sources to give the ad the videogame style. The layout was chosen to
                            fit not only a magazine ad, but also to give the look of what a game case looked like for older videogame consoles.

                        This assignment was meant to be a zine syle booklet that focused on the wonder found in different forms
                        of art, ranging from photography to architecture to paintings. The content focused on several famous
                        artists such as Frank Gehry to Michaelangelo with several key art theories being used to deconstruct
                        or look deeper into their art to try to find the source of wonder.

                        When creating this assignment the first thing I focused on was creating and sectioning the written work.
                        Once that was completed I figured out colour palettes for each of the different sections of the magazine,
                        and created basic backgrounds in <b>Adobe Illustrator</b>. Depending on the theme of each of the artists changed what details
                        I chose to include, and how many. Once the backgrounds were complete I created the character along with several poses and mouths,
                        then Ibrought the assets into <b>Adobe InDesign</b>. Once everything was assembled I created invisible shapes over top of the
                        content to wrap the text around. From there I created the text columns and inserted the content, with minor adjustments.
